## 🔒 Security Notice

We put your security first:
- Passwords are **encrypted** on your device using modern cryptography (Fernet symmetric encryption).
- Your encryption key and PIN are **never transmitted** or stored outside your own computer.
- If you lose your `secret.key` or `pin.key` files, your passwords cannot be recovered — this is by design!

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer is recommended.
- The script will auto-install any missing dependencies (like `cryptography` and `pyperclip`) the first time you run it.

2. **Open a terminal** in the project folder.
3. **Run the script:**

   python passwordstogo.py

5. **On first use:**
